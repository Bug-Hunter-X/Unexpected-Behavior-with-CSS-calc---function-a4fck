The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS, but it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not used carefully.  For example, if you try to calculate a value that results in a `NaN` (Not a Number), the calculation will fail silently, and the element will not be styled as expected.  Another issue is the order of operations. Make sure you use parentheses `()` appropriately to control the order of calculations.  Finally, using `calc()` with units that cannot be combined (e.g., adding pixels and percentages directly) will also lead to errors.
