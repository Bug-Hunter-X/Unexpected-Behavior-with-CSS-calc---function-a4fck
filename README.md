# Unexpected Behavior with CSS calc() Function

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The `bug.css` file shows examples of these errors, while `bugSolution.css` provides corrected versions.

**Common issues with `calc()` include:**

* **NaN (Not a Number) results:** Incorrect calculations leading to undefined values.
* **Order of operations:** Unexpected results due to incorrect use of parentheses.
* **Incompatible units:** Mixing incompatible units in the same calculation (e.g., pixels and percentages directly).

The examples provided illustrate these problems and demonstrate how to correctly use the `calc()` function for reliable styling.
